# [Food Allergy Checker](https://fascinating-crisp-96c7ec.netlify.app/)

## Description

Food Allergy Checker is a web application that empowers users to make informed dietary choices by helping them identify foods that meet their specific requirements, including dietary restrictions and preferences. This project was developed using a stack of modern technologies, including Node.js, React, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features to be added

The web application will soon include the following key features:

1. **Dietary Recommendations**: Halal-Food offers a powerful recommendation system that suggests alternative food options based on users' dietary restrictions, promoting healthier and safer eating habits.

2. **Islamic Dietary Verification**: To enhance inclusivity, we have incorporated a dedicated component that allows users to verify whether a food product aligns with Islamic dietary restrictions, making it easier for those who adhere to Halal guidelines.
